# TruthLens Enhanced Loading UX with Text Highlighting

## Overview
Enhanced the user experience by implementing loading cursors, visual indicators, and text highlighting during fact-checking HTTP requests.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Loading Cursor on Webpage
- **Wait Cursor**: The entire webpage shows a "wait" cursor during fact-checking
- **Visual Progress Bar**: A subtle animated progress bar appears at the top of the page
- **Subtle Overlay**: A very light overlay indicates the page is in "fact-checking mode"

### 2. Text Highlighting üÜï
- **Smart Text Detection**: Automatically finds and highlights the selected text being fact-checked
- **Animated Highlight**: Beautiful gradient background with pulsing animation
- **Verification Badge**: A spinning üîç icon badge appears next to highlighted text
- **Precise Targeting**: Only highlights the first occurrence of the selected text
- **Clean Removal**: Highlights are completely removed when verification completes

### 3. Enhanced Popup Loading State
- **Loading Spinner**: Animated spinner in the popup
- **Loading Cursor**: The popup itself shows a wait cursor
- **Enhanced Message**: More informative loading message with emoji and description

### 4. Robust Error Handling
- **Timeout Protection**: Automatic removal of loading state after 30 seconds
- **Error Recovery**: Loading cursors and highlights are removed even if requests fail
- **Console Logging**: Better debugging with detailed console messages
- **Badge Cleanup**: Ensures verification badges are properly removed

### 5. Technical Implementation
- **Separate CSS**: `content.css` for webpage-specific styles
- **Message Passing**: Enhanced communication between background, content, and popup scripts
- **CSS Injection**: Dynamically injected styles for seamless integration
- **DOM Tree Walking**: Intelligent text node traversal for accurate highlighting

## Files Modified

1. **`css/index.css`**: Added loading cursor classes for popup
2. **`css/content.css`**: Webpage loading styles, text highlighting, and animations  
3. **`js/content.js`**: Enhanced with highlighting logic, CSS injection, and timeout management
4. **`js/background.js`**: Improved error handling, tab communication, and text passing
5. **`js/popup.js`**: Added loading cursor to popup container
6. **`manifest.json`**: Added content.css to web_accessible_resources

## User Experience Flow

1. **User selects text** ‚Üí Right-click ‚Üí "Verify with TruthLens"
2. **Immediately**: 
   - Loading cursor appears across the entire webpage
   - Selected text is highlighted with animated gradient background
   - Spinning verification badge (üîç) appears next to highlighted text
   - Progress bar shows at top of page
   - Popup shows loading spinner
3. **During HTTP request**: Clear visual feedback that specific text is being analyzed
4. **When complete**: All loading indicators and highlights are cleanly removed
5. **Results displayed**: Normal interaction restored with verification results

## Highlighting Features

### Visual Design
- **Gradient Background**: Purple-blue gradient with opacity for readability
- **Pulsing Animation**: Subtle breathing effect to draw attention
- **Verification Badge**: Animated spinning magnifying glass icon
- **Smart Positioning**: Badge positioned relative to highlighted text

### Technical Details
- **Text Node Traversal**: Uses `createTreeWalker` for efficient DOM navigation
- **Case-Insensitive Matching**: Finds text regardless of case differences
- **Single Occurrence**: Only highlights the first match to avoid visual clutter
- **Clean DOM Manipulation**: Proper text node handling and cleanup

### Error Prevention
- **Try-Catch Blocks**: Prevents extension crashes from DOM manipulation errors
- **Fallback Methods**: Alternative highlighting approaches if primary method fails
- **Orphan Cleanup**: Removes any leftover badges or highlights
- **Node Normalization**: Merges text nodes after cleanup

## Benefits

- **Immediate Feedback**: Users know their action was registered
- **Visual Progress**: Clear indication that processing is happening  
- **Text Context**: Users can see exactly what text is being verified
- **Professional Feel**: More polished and responsive user experience
- **Error Prevention**: Prevents confusion during network delays
- **Accessibility**: Clear visual cues for all users
- **Non-Intrusive**: Highlights don't interfere with page functionality

## Fallback Mechanisms

- **Timeout Protection**: 30-second automatic cleanup
- **Error Recovery**: Loading and highlights removed on any error
- **Try-Catch Blocks**: Prevents extension crashes
- **Console Warnings**: Helpful debugging information
- **DOM Validation**: Checks for element existence before manipulation
- **Badge Orphan Cleanup**: Removes any stray verification badges
